    "## Interpolation Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to talk about the errors in an interpolating polynomial, we must assume that there is a reasonably well behaved underlying function $f(x)$.  The error can the be characterized by asking: What is $f(x)-p_n(x)$?  \n",
    "\n",
    ">  Theorem: Given *distinct* $x_0, x_1, ... , x_n$ in an interval $[a,b]$, and with $f(x)\\in C^{n+1}[a,b]$, \n",
    ">  for any $x\\in[a,b]$  there exists $\\xi\\in(a,b)$ such that   \n",
    ">\n",
    ">  $$\\begin{equation} f(x)-p_n(x) = \\frac{f^{n+1}(\\xi)}{(n+1)!}\\prod_{j=0}^n (x-x_j). \\end{equation} {eq}`inter_err`$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Take some fixed $x\\in[a,b]$.  If $x=x_k$ for some $k$ then the error formula {ref}`inter_err` gives zero (which is, indeed the true error as the interpolating polynomial agrees with the function at node points by definition).  If $x\\neq x_k$, then let's define an auxiliary function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(t)=f(t)-p_n(t) - \\left[ f(x)-p_n(x) \\right] \\frac{(t-x_0)(t-x_1)...(t-x_n)}{(x-x_0)(x-x_1)...(x-x_n)}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now note that $g(t)=0$ for $t=x_k$ (for any $k$) because the numerator in the last term will contain the factor $(t-x_k)$ which is zero at $t=x_k$ and the first two terms cancel at $t=x_k$ as $f(x_k)=p_n(x_k)$ by definition of the interpolating polynomial.  Also note that $g(t)=0$ for $t=x$ as well as the fraction last term is one and the remaining terms cancel for $t=x$.  As a result, we see that $g(t)$ has $n+2$ zeros (at $x$ and at $x_0, x_1,...,x_n$).  \n",
