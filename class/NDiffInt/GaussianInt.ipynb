    "## Gaussian Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have focussed on integration schemes where the function is sampled at regular intervals.  These are very useful for data that comes to us in this form, but if we wish to integrate a known function as accurately as possible it is better to take advantage of the freedom we have to choose our nodes, just as we did for interpolation where selecting Chebyshev points was optimal.\n",

    "Consider that quadrature formulas are typically of the form\n",

    "\n",
    "which has $2n$ parameters (note for this section we are stopping the sum at $n-1$ rather than $n$ as this is conventional for Gaussian quadrature formulas).  The idea of Gaussian integration is that with these $2n$ parameters it should be possible to chose them to ensure that we can integrate all polynomials of degree less than or equal to $2n-1$ *exactly*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do this, it is useful to first transform to a standard interval, namely $y$ in $[-1,1]$, from the original $x$ in $[a,b]$.  Similar to what we did with the Chebyshev interpolation, we use the change of variables\n",

(To construct $q(x)$ you pick its coefficients so that $q(x)P_n(x)$ has coefficients that match coefficients of $p(x)$ for terms $x^{2n-1}$ to $x^n$.  $r(x)$ is then whatever is left over).  Now,\n",
